## _Consecutive Duplicates_

Given a string s, consisting of `"X"` and `"Y"`s, delete the minimum number of characters such that there's no consecutive `"X"` and no consecutive `"Y"`.

## Constraints
- `n â‰¤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of `s`.

## Examples
**<u>Input</u>**

``s = "YYYXYXX"``

**<u>Output</u>**

`"YXYX"`

**<u>Why</u>**

`One solution is to delete the first two "Y"s and the last "X".`
